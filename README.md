To use make venv or create or have a conda environment with the dependencies in requirements.txt fx

```bash
conda create -n sankey_sankey python=3.8
conda install pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or you can install the dependencies with 

```bash
conda install pkg_name
```

Run with:

```python
python main.py

Should be no problem it generates a html with the sankey plot
